# Useless Box

This is an attempt to mimic a useless box in code. Please refer to this video to see a useless box in action

# Inspiration
This project spawned out of a desire to build a robust and intelligent useless box (with a discernible personality).
Usually these toys stay sequestered to the realm of side projects and games, but I feel it would be interesting to build
a clever one with some additional features (USB charging ports, a little screen, bluetooth speaker, an accompanying app).)
Basically a clever gadget that will look cool on top of a desk and won't be entirely useless.

Thinking about how I could explore this for our 98 project, I decided to attempt to mimic the experience with a simple C++ 
program.

# How to run
Compile useless.cpp and run it.

# What I learned
It would likely be easier to attempt this with Python or some other higher level programming language, but I decided to stick
to C++ because thas is likely the language that would go inside the Box. Nevertheless as is often the case with C++ I became 
familiar with different methods used to control the system, flush STDOUT, and take input. 

The program is very basic but I can already imagine how scaling would be an issue with my current architecture in the Box.
